CBA is a popular place to for Master theses students. This year a record number of 18 theses were completed with someone from CBA as either supervisor or reviewer. Most of the theses were initiated from outside CBA, either from industry or from other university departments. CBA is also involved in undergraduate courses. We organize courses in image analysis and visualization (3.1.1-4) and participate in various other courses.

%Staff from CBA organizes and participates in many undergraduate courses. % at UU and SLU.
%%even though we are not officially the unit responsible for them. 
%We organize and teach the courses in image analysis and computer graphics,
%but we also teach other courses, such as programming (in C++ and Java) and mathematics. 
%Listed in this section are the courses we have been involved in, as course organizers (3.1.1, 3.1.3, 3.1.5, 3.1.7, 3.1.8) and/or teachers. Course responsible teacher is written in bold.
