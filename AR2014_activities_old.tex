%In addition to research and teaching, our time is taken up with many other things. In this section we list the most important of those. We are often involved in conference organisation (as visualized on the cover) and this year more so than usual. In addition to the International Symposium on Mathematical Morphology we were organisers of six other meetings or sessions and served in the programme committees of twelve conferences. 
In addition to research and teaching, our time is taken up with many other things. In this section we list the most important of those. We are often involved in conference organisation (as visualized on the cover) and this year more so than usual. In addition to the International Symposium on Mathematical Morphology and the SSBA (Swedish Society for Image Analysis) Summer School we were organisers of six other meetings or sessions and served in the programme committees of twelve conferences. 

Giving seminars is also an important way to communicating our research, both outside CBA, this year mostly at other UU departments, and internally in our own seminar series were a seminar is given each Monday afternoon. The many conference involvements have of course led to many conference presentations, as special invited speakers (9), as oral presenters (9) and as poster presenters (13). There have also been 13 presentations at non-reviewed meetings. 

Having world class scientists visiting us and visiting their groups for longer or shorter periods is an important part of international science. This year we had Punam Saha (University of Iowa) visiting for three months, which started a number of interesting co-operations. Two of our PhD students visited Centre for Mathematical Morphology in Paris and Okinawa Institute of Science and technology for two months each. There were also many interesting shorter visits and visitors. 

Finally, we are engaged in many different international and national committees, especially our professors. This ranges from being Editors of scientific journals, being Fellows or members of scientific organisations to being part of different university committees, from reviewing scientific papers and grant applications to being part of dissertation defence committees. The most prestigious are probably that Nystr\"{o}m is Secretary of the International Association for Pattern Recognition and that Borgefors is Editor-in-Chief for Pattern Recognition Letters. In Figure~\ref{fig:journals_edit_CBA}, journals with CBA staff in the editorial board are shown.

\subsection{Organized conferences and workshops}
\begin{enumerate}
\label{sec:organized_conferences}
\item 
{\bf 11th International Symposium on Mathematical Morphology (ISMM 2013)} \\
{\em Organisers:} Gunilla Borgefors (General Chair), Cris Luengo Hendriks (Programme Chair), Robin Strand (Local arrangements Chair), Christer Kiselman (Invited speakers Chair), Vladimir {\'C}uri{\'c} (assistant)\\
{\em Address:} {\AA}ngstr\"{o}m, Uppsala \\
{\em Date:} 20130527--20130529 \\
{\em Attendees:} 69 \\
{\em Comment:} ISMM 2013 was the eleventh in a series of international conferences on Mathematical Morphology and its applications. We received 52 submissions, most of high quality, of which 41 were accepted after review and revision. There were also three invited papers, by Bhabatosh Chanda, Indian Statistical Institute; Ron Kimmel, Israel Institute of Technology; and Christine Voiron-Canicio, University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis, France. The Proceedings of the meeting is {\em Mathematical Morphology and Its Applications to Signal and Image Processing,} Eds. C.L. Luengo Hendriks, G. Borgefors, R. Strand, published as Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 7883, 532 pages. In addition to the three invited speakers there were 26 oral presentations in plenary sessions and two poster sessions with a total of 15 posters. There were 69 registered participants from 13 countries, with most participants from France. The conference dinner was held at \"{O}stg\"{o}ta Nation on the first conference evening and the conference ended with a farewell lunch. The conference was sponsored by International Association of Pattern Recognition (IAPR) and had financial sponsoring from the Swedish Research Council (VR), UU, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences and the City of Uppsala. Just after the symposium the steering committee held a meeting at CBA. We received many compliments on the organisation of this conference from the participants. See Figure~\ref{fig:ISMM_images}.

{\bf Contributing to Open-Source Software}\\
{\em Organisers:} Carolina W\"{a}hlby~\\
{\em Address:} Centre for Image Analysis, Uppsala \\
{\em Date:} 130603--0605\\
{\em Comment:} The goal of the workshop was to let the participants become familiar with open-source tools, and learn how to make contributions/modifications to MeVisLab, ImageJ/FIJI and CellProfiler. These initiatives are valuable sources for already implemented algorithms, making them a great starting point for further exploration and development, as well as reproducible comparison of competing methods. By becoming more familiar with these tools, and learning how to make contributions/modifications, the participants have a valuable toolbox that can be shared and used also outside the university. 

Guest tutorials were presented by Felix Ritter and Anja Hennemuth (MevisLab, Fraunhofer MEVIS), Lee Kamentsky (CellProfiler, Broad Institute, USA), and Kevin Eliceiri ImageJ2/FIji, LOCI, University of Wisconsin, USA).
